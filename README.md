# appointmentApp

Based on the following criteria I created this AngularJS app.

The application will need to do the following:
* Show a list of appointments in chronological order by start time
* Load from a JSON file sample data, and render it in the application
* Create an appointment
* Update an appointment
* Delete an appointment

You must use client-side Javascript to complete this application (jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS).
